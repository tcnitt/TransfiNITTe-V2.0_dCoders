# Title of Project -
NIT-T Hospital App

# Description -
This project was developed with the aim to help students with all hospital related queries & services along with providing them with emergency services.
The app is three different target audiences -

Students - 
For the students the app is designed to provide information about currently prevalant seasonal diseases and what precautions they should be taking on the home page along with the different departments in the hospitals and the doctors who specialize in that given department and whether they are available at the moment, this information is to help them know which doctor they should be approaching for any specific problems.
The homepage also houses the "SOS" button, this has the option to contact ambulance directly or the Apollo hospital directly. In cases of ambulance unavailability, a special feature of contact volunteer is provided. This contacts the nearest person to the patient based on location and time.

Students can view the details about the services provided by the hospital under the "services" section. It covers wards, medical equipment, clinical lab, pharmacy and physiotherapy clinic details along with timings. There is a seperate subsection for "pharmacy" where users can view which medicines are in stock in the pharmacy to pick up medicines which weren't available during their earlier visit.
The "medical records" section is included to provide students and doctors an easy way to view their past medical conditions and mediciations recommended.
Finally there is the option to view important contacts and a chat bot that covers some of the first aid information that can be useful in a quick situation.

Doctors - 
Doctors are able to use the app to first set whether they are in the hospital or not to help the students know when they should be approaching for specific conditions. It also provides the functionality to add patient reports (which can then be viewed in the student's "medical records" section).
They are also able to view the medicines stocked in the pharmacy should they require the information.

Ambulance services -
Ambulances can use the app to continuously update their availability directly without manual intervention. If the ambulance is further away than a certain distance from campus, the "contact ambulance" button is disabled and volunteers are directly contacted instead.
